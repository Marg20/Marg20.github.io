	Eating healthier is a goal that most of us have on our to-do lists but a lot of the time it seems as though everything is going against you to achieve that. Questions like, Why does eating healthy seem so expensive? What do I eat? How do I make it? People with a strict grocery budget are highly affected by this problem. How might we help budget conscious families eat healthier and save time so they can improve their quality of life and spend more valuable time with their friends and family.

	Our idea was to create an app that helps people make healthier eating choices, make healthy food affordable, and  help people stay motivated. We wanted this digital solution to work for anyone with low income and wanting to adapt a healthier lifestyle.

Our main objectives  were to understand how much time is spent in planning and preparing meals, how families budget groceries, and how they find the best prices on food. We were able to pull a great deal of data from the interviews we conducted. We then organized that data and grouped them into similarities. This helped us begin to understand what features and tools our users enjoyed and what features they were in need of. Our users were low income, whose healthy eating habits were affected by their income. They looked for new recipes on apps and on the internet but also found cooking too time consuming.

	From  the surveys we conducted we realized and understood the main pain points of our users. Most of the people we talked to were honestly interested to makelifestyle changes and try to eat healthier, but we found out that cooking is time consuming, the can't stick into a new habit long enough, healthy food is expensive,cooking is time consuming  and vey often they just don't know what to make.

	Our affinity diagram helped us develop our user persona. Jessica, a 33 year old woman from Salt Lake City is married with young children. Jessica makes $50,000 a year as a customer service agent. She enjoys spending time with her family and on her photography hobby. She also knows how important self care is, she exercises daily and wants her family to eat healthier. Jessica works long hours, has a tight budget, and finds it hard to make time to prepare healthy meals. Jessica would like a tool that could help her know what to cook and how to prepare it.

	Ideating User Focused Features
	</div>
	<div class="usecase-text-section-text">
	As a team we used the “I like, I wish, What if,” method of brainstorming in order to articulate features that our users liked and what features would be helpful to develop. This was an important step in understanding what features we should include in the What’s Cookin' app. A few key things we learned were that our users liked pictures, meal prep videos, and wanted to save time. We then set up a prioritization matrix to help us decide what features would be most valuable. The key features we focused on were the ability to find recipes quickly through tag filters, to have nutrition facts easily available, and to provide a list of ingredients and price breakdown by specific stores they choose.

	To do our testing we set up four recorded zoom sessions. These sessions allowed us to see and make notes on how users interacted with the app. The testers were encouraged to vocalize their responses, and this gave us insight into features the user was searching for and what features the user found helpful. After completing user tests it was clear there were a few changes that we needed to make. We changed the icon of the list from a pencil to a notebook, making it easier to navigate to the list page. We also changed the edit function on the list page by adding the swipe interaction to delete each line item. We all felt that changes would make it much easier for users to navigate through our app.
